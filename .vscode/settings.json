  /* Avoid auto-reformat of upstream C files. Ideally this would be a
     per-language setting so we could still have formatOnSave of Jit/ and
     RuntimeTests/ cpp files, but that breaks down with `.h` files, which are
     auto-detected as "cpp", not "c", so there's no way on a per-language basis
     to distinguish .h files in upstream C code vs .h files in our cpp code. And
     we can't modify the file association for .h files because VSCode doesn't
     support "files.associations" setting in implicit workspace settings files.
