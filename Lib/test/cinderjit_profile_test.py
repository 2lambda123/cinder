# Some tests want to make sure the type-specialized code behaves correctly when
# given a type that was not seen during profiling. The simplest and most
# reliable way to do this (given the current system) is to allow the code under
# test to behave differently during profiling and testing.

# We expose this within this file through the PROFILING and TESTING globals,
# which will never both be set at the same time (they might both be false, if
# the JIT is disabled). This assumes that calling code will set
# CINDER_JIT_PROFILE_TEST_PROFILING as appropriate.
